# Triathlon Training

## Intro
I'm looking to make a guide similar to [jwasham/coding-interview-university](https://github.com/jwasham/coding-interview-university) for training towards a triathlon (or any endurance sport, really) coming from someone with an anaerobic/sprint background.

## Why GitHub?
- Markdown is easy and simple
- Can develop this document and program much like a software project

## What to ~spend a lot of money on~ invest in
For the uninitiated, this is in general, a **really expensive** sport at the pro level, especially for bike-related gear. It is entirely possible to train without much of what will be described; however, the long-term benefits will be worth the cost.

- Coach
- Chest HR monitor
- Power meter
- Decent road bike
- Trainer/turbo

## Training Technique

### Swim

### Bike
#### Wind resistance and Power
- There's some math involved, but basically, your power will increase in a cubic relationship when your velocity increases, assuming factors like frontal surface area of the cyclist remain equal. Effectively, physics/wind resistance has given us an O(n^3) algorithm for our legs, which is *very bad*

- Solution: draft, which effectively negates a lot of wind resistance
- In a race, you can't draft unless it's draft legal, but aerobars will reduce your frontal area


### Run
- I suck at run, therefore I'm not talking about this (for now).
